# Aegis - Discord Spam Detection System

## Project Overview
Aegis is a specialized spam detection system designed to combat betting promoter spam in Discord servers. The system consists of:
- An LSTM neural network trained on betting-related spam patterns
- A Discord bot interface for real-time message monitoring
- Interactive learning capabilities for continuous model improvement

## Spam Detection Components

### 1. Text Processing (`clean_text`)
- **Character Substitution Handling**:
  - Normalizes common evasion tactics (e.g., "p!cks" → "picks")
  - Handles number substitutions (1 → i, 3 → e, 0 → o)
  - Processes symbol replacements (@ → a, $ → s)
  - Removes censoring characters (* and #)
- **Optimization**:
  - Skips processing for short words (≤ 2 characters)
  - Only processes words containing special characters
  - Preserves emojis and legitimate special characters

### 2. Data Management
- **Loading Data** (`load_data`):
  - Reads real messages from CSV format
  - Loads spam messages from text file
  - Combines and labels datasets (0 for real, 1 for spam)

- **Sequence Preparation** (`prepare_sequences`):
  - Tokenizes text using up to 10,000 most common words
  - Pads sequences to 50 tokens
  - Handles out-of-vocabulary words with '<OOV>' token

### 3. Model Architecture (`create_model`)
```python
Sequential(
    Embedding(10000, 100, input_length=50),
    LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    Dropout(0.3),
    LSTM(32),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
)
```

### 4. Model Operations
- **Prediction** (`predict_message`):
  - Processes new messages through the cleaning pipeline
  - Returns spam probability and binary classification
  - Threshold-based classification (default: 0.5)

- **Model Persistence** (`save_model_artifacts`, `load_model_artifacts`):
  - Saves/loads model weights
  - Preserves tokenizer vocabulary
  - Maintains consistent sequence parameters

### 5. Interactive Learning System
- **Feedback Processing**:
  - Collects user feedback on predictions
  - Handles false negatives through model updates
  - Saves new spam patterns for future training

- **Model Updates** (`add_spam_message`, `update_model_with_message`):
  - Balanced mini-batch training (20 messages per class)
  - Higher learning rate (0.001) for quick adaptation
  - Preserves existing knowledge while learning new patterns
  - Immediate model update verification

### 6. Usage Modes

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
python spam_detector.py
```
- Continuous message input/evaluation loop
- Real-time prediction feedback
- Model updates based on user corrections

#### Key Commands
- Enter message to check for spam
- Provide feedback (y/n) on prediction accuracy
- 'quit'/'q'/'exit' to end session

## Performance Characteristics
- Typical accuracy: 92-95% on betting spam detection
- Lower effectiveness on non-gambling related spam
- Requires retraining for new spam categories

## Discord Bot Implementation (Aegis)
- Features:
  - Real-time message scanning using spam_detector_model
  - Automated spam handling:
    - Delete high-confidence spam messages
    - Temporary mute for repeat offenders
    - Moderator alert channel for borderline cases
  - Whitelist system for trusted users/roles
  - Custom threshold configuration per server

## Model Training Details

### Training Data
- **Non-spam messages**: Collected from legitimate conversations (`data/real_messages.csv`)
- **Spam messages**: Synthetic samples from known spam patterns (`data/spam_messages.txt`)

### Training Process
1. **Initial Training**:
   - 80/20 train-test split
   - Early stopping with 3 epochs patience
   - Validation split: 0.2
   - Batch size: 32
   - Maximum epochs: 10

2. **Incremental Updates**:
   - Mini-batch size: 8
   - Training epochs: 3
   - Temporarily increased learning rate
   - Balanced sampling of existing data

## Future Improvements
- Deployment as a Discord bot is pending.
- Generalization to non-gambling related spam is pending.
- Additional model architecture tuning is pending.

## Generalization Potential

### 1. Expanding Beyond Betting Spam
The current model architecture can be adapted for different spam categories by:
- Retraining on new domain-specific datasets
- Adjusting the vocabulary size and embedding dimensions
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for the new domain

#### Potential Application Domains
1. **Cryptocurrency Scams**
   - Token pump-and-dump schemes
   - Fake exchange promotions
   - Mining pool scams
   
2. **Phishing Attempts**
   - Fake Discord nitro offers
   - Account verification scams
   - Server raid coordination

3. **Commercial Spam**
   - Unauthorized server advertisements
   - Drop shipping promotions
   - Account selling/trading

### 2. Architecture Adaptations
The model can be enhanced for broader spam detection through:

1. **Multi-Label Classification**
   - Categorize different types of spam
   - Provide specific threat levels
   - Enable targeted response actions

2. **Language-Specific Models**
   - Train separate models for different languages
   - Implement language detection preprocessing
   - Handle multilingual servers effectively

3. **Pattern Recognition Improvements**
   - Expand character substitution patterns
   - Add regex-based feature extraction
   - Implement URL and domain analysis

### 3. Scalability Features

1. **Cross-Server Learning**
   - Share spam patterns across servers
   - Maintain server-specific whitelists
   - Implement privacy-preserving pattern sharing

2. **Adaptive Thresholds**
   - Dynamic confidence thresholds
   - Server-specific customization
   - Activity-based adjustment

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - Batch processing for efficiency
   - Caching frequent patterns
   - Distributed model deployment

### 4. Integration Capabilities

1. **API Extensions**
   - REST API for external services
   - Webhook support for notifications
   - Integration with moderation bots

2. **Reporting System**
   - Detailed spam analytics
   - Pattern emergence detection
   - Effectiveness metrics

3. **Community Features**
   - Collaborative pattern reporting
   - Trusted moderator network
   - Shared blocklist management

### 5. Privacy and Security

1. **Data Protection**
   - Message anonymization
   - Sensitive data filtering
   - GDPR compliance features

2. **Attack Prevention**
   - Anti-poisoning measures
   - Rate limiting
   - Abuse prevention

The model's LSTM architecture and character substitution handling provide a strong foundation for these expansions, requiring primarily:
1. Additional training data for new domains
2. Architecture adjustments for specific use cases
3. Implementation of supporting features for scalability
4. Development of integration interfaces

This generalization would transform the current betting-focused system into a comprehensive spam detection platform suitable for diverse Discord communities.
